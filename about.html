    <h2>
      Shot on film
    </h2>
    <p>
      All photos are shot on film. I don't use photoshop or any other post-processing software. I shoot with Nikon N80 and a bunch of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smena_(camera)">funky cameras</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How the funk?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since I don't post-process my photos, you might be wondering how come some of them are so
      <a href="#">weird-looking</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret is something called
      <a href="https://crossprocessing.info/">crossâ€“processing</a>. I shoot on slide film and develop it in C-41 (chemicals designed to work with negatives).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever comes out on the other end of the scanner ends up on this website untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end result varies depending on the particular film type and brand. Over the years, I figured out what works best for me. The funkiest funkyness on this site is a result of cross-processing Kodak slide film.

    <h2>
      You should try film photography
    </h2>
    <p>
      Imagine getting drunk, going online and buying yourself a present for your birthday. A month passes, and you get the package. You vaguely remember what you ordered, but not quite. It can be something awesome, or it can blow up glitter in your face. That's what it feels like.

    <h2>
      This website
    </h2>
    <p>
      I started this website in 2004, and despite irregular updates and having next to nothing to do with my daily life, I
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060417215542/http://funkysideoftown.com/archives.html">insisted</a> on calling it a photoblog.
    </p>
    <p>
      I moved to all-film in 2008/2009 and took down digital photos in 2016.

      All photos were taken by me, Maciej Szafraniec. Some multiple exposure shots were shared with other photographers.
